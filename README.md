Neighborhood Analysis for Real Estate Investing in Rome
The project aims at understanding the main factors determining house prices in Rome. The characteristics affecting property prices might include the distance from the city center, the density of population, the presence of different kinds of venues, like such as number of shops, restaurants, professional buildings, museums, universities, cafes, hotels, gyms and more, the traffic, the percentage of the foreign-born population. Such data gathered from Foursquare and other open sources will be used to cluster the 154 neighborhoods of Rome and understand the relationship between the price and the location of a property.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71321348/121043270-c189b400-c7b4-11eb-92c5-0269dfddd7ba.png)
